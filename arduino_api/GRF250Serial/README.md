# GRF250Serial
API and examples for the GRF-250 over the serial interface.

# Usage
Copy this directory to your Arduino IDE Libraries folder.
You can then use the examples in the Arduino IDE by going to File -> Examples -> GRF250Serial.

# Examples
- Basic: Shows how to use the API in the most straight forward way possible, using a user supplied serial interface to communicate with the GRF-250.

- Callbacks: Shows how to use custom callbacks for more control over the communication with the GRF-250.

- Unmanaged: Shows how to communicate with the GRF-250 by constructing requests and parsing responses manually.
